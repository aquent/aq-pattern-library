# Asides

## To-Do

1. Can we scope `<h4>` styling to the `<aside>` and drop the `subheader side-separator` classes so that the h4 is "just right" when used inside an aside?
2. Is there any case where an `<aside>` _isn't_ orange? If orange is the de-facto default, let's eliminate the need for `bg-orange` and just make them orange.
3. Is there any case where an `<aside>` _isn't_ also a `.panel`? If not, let's just roll those rules into the base pattern.
4. Make header separators' color not reliant on lots of parent classing.
5. Make padding intrinsic to the `<aside>`
6. If necessary, create width demonstrations for different presentation cases (unclear if currently the only use case is inside a `.layout-compressed`)
7. Document utility classes for `<asides>` (e.g. `.aside-right`)
