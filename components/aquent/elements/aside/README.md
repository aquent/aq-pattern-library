# Asides

## To-Do

1. Can we scope `<h4>` styling to the `<aside>` and drop the `subheader side-separator` classes so that the h4 is "just right" when used inside an aside?
2. Is there any case where an `<aside>` _isn't_ orange? If orange is the de-facto default, let's eliminate the need for `bg-orange` and just make them orange.
3. Is there any case where an `<aside>` _isn't_ also a `.panel`? If not, let's just roll those rules into the base pattern.
